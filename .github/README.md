## :camera: Showcase

<div align="center">

##### Tokyo Night Colorscheme

Tokyo night colorscheme ported from [zatchheems](https://github.com/zatchheems/tokyo-night-alacritty-theme) for alacritty

<img src="assets/2.jpg">

##### Application Launcher

A slightly modified version of the fancy rofi app launcher found on [siduck's repo](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm/tree/main/rofi)

<img src="assets/rofimenu.jpg" width="400">

##### Right-click Application Menu

  <div align="left">

The menu is spawned with the help of [xqp](https://github.com/baskerville/xqp) (or X Query Pointer) which prints the ID of the window under the pointer. This is used to check if RMB is being triggered on an empty space, which then calls `jgmenu` to spawn out from the position of the pointer. This method works most accurately since it allows you to spawn the application menu even if your current desktop is occupied (assuming you have gaps between windows)

##### Notifications

Dunst for a simple notification daemon. eww notification history panel coming soon

<img src="assets/dunst.jpg" width="400">

##### Drop-down Systray

<div align="left">

Stalonetray is run at bootup and hid right after using [xdo](https://github.com/baskerville/xdo). [`systray`](https://github.com/beyond9thousand/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/systray) local binary is run via a custom ipc module defined in [`modules.ini`](https://github.com/beyond9thousand/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/not_in_use/polybar) which hides or unhides the tray as necessary.
